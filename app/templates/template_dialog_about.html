                    A special thanks to friends and family. Without inspiration, we can accomplish nothing. Thank you for your support, caffeine refills, and contributions.

                    Also, a warm thank you to the community, and everyone who makes work such as this fun! Keep it frosty, and see you on the battlefield!
